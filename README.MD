#Music History App
##A Nashville Software School project by Allen Phelps

This is a student project to familiarize myself with Angular JS.
As this is not hosted anywhere, you will need to clone this repository and run a local server in order to check it out.
Also, you will **install bower dependencies** in order for this project to run properly.

Currently, the project is set up to allow a user to manage a personal database of songs.

I welcome comments, suggestions, and *friendly* advice.

Features:
Login using Firebase/oAuth. Including Github and Facebook log in options.
Individualized libraries managed via Firebase.
